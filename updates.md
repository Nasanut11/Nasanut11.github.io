# Project Updates

*Update 1/13/2021*: Construction of the pillar base for corals to sit on has begun. This image on the right is a concept drawing for the "pillar" of corals that will be designed for the Master's Thesis. The 3D printed corals can be seen stuck to the rockwork, made from pink insulation foam and painted, to simulate an aesthetically pleasing naturalistic structure. Below is the first cut "draft" of the pillar made from pink insulation foam. Each level was cut out from the cardboard template seen in the bottom left of the image, though only used loosely meaning every level has a different variation.

*Update 2/03/2021*: *PILLAR IDEA IS OUT!* Change of plans, going back to the original concept of having a "2D landscape" where the corals will sit on. Essentially this horizontal platform will house the corals, foam "rockwork" to give the sculpture dimensionality, and have projection from above. Right now the challenge is deciding to make the projection gantry higher to cast more of a "rectangular" image over the base, or make the base smaller and more square to fit the current projection height. These challenges will be discussed and options weighed to create the finalized version. The image on the right is a prototype sketch of the colors that will be displayed on top of the corals. While it's an imperfect sketch overtop a top-down image, the "white tips" actually look more natural since corals like these calcify as they grow.
