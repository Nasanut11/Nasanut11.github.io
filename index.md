# **Project White Reefs**

This Masters thesis I am pursuing is for the University of Central Florida's M.A. in Digital Media. The project I am hoping to create is a revival of a previous work of mine, Project White Reefs. The project is designed to raise awareness of the bleaching of coral reefs around the world as a result of human driven climate change. The goal is to design an interactive STEAM (science, technology, education, arts, mathematics) instillation that allows users to directly influence the "life" of the corals through a projection mapped surface. Through interaction, the corals will lose their coloration revealing the stark white "skeleton" of the corals underneath. This project is designed to create an emotional response from the users through direct interaction and observation.
